    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my project</h2>
    <p>I am a high school student, and I hate AI art, so made this project to create a space with no AI.
    I think all artist are tired of endless AI slop flooding every social media app.
    So I decided to try to give my share by giving all the talented artists a space to share their creations,
    and for people like me, who enjoy a real art to see it. No matter of the what kind of art,
    you can freely share it for other people to see.</p>
    <p>All art is art, except AI! HOORAH!</p>
    <p>You can support my project on <a>BuyMeACoffe</a>!</p>
    <p> Hope you enjoy!</p>
